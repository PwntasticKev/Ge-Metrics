Be extremely concise, Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision

# Behavioral Rules
1. **Ambiguity Protocol:** If any task is unclear or has multiple implementation paths, always use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to clarify my intent before writing code.
2. **Commit Workflow:** After completing a coding task, always prompt to use the `commit-commands` plugin to stage and commit the changes with a descriptive message.
3. **Verification:** Before finishing a task, ask me a follow-up question to verify that the output meets my specific requirements.
