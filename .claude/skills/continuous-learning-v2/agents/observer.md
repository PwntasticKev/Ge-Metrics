# Observer Agent

A background agent that analyzes observations from Claude Code sessions to detect patterns and create instincts.

## When to Run

- After significant session activity (20+ tool calls)
- When user runs `/analyze-patterns`
- On a scheduled interval (configurable, default 5 minutes)
- When triggered by observation hook (SIGUSR1)

## Input

Reads observations from `~/.claude/homunculus/observations.jsonl`:

```jsonl
{"timestamp":"2025-01-22T10:30:00Z","event":"tool_start","session":"abc123","tool":"Edit","input":"..."}
{"timestamp":"2025-01-22T10:30:01Z","event":"tool_complete","session":"abc123","tool":"Edit","output":"..."}
{"timestamp":"2025-01-22T10:30:05Z","event":"tool_start","session":"abc123","tool":"Bash","input":"npm test"}
{"timestamp":"2025-01-22T10:30:10Z","event":"tool_complete","session":"abc123","tool":"Bash","output":"All tests pass"}
```

## Pattern Detection

Look for these patterns in observations:

### 1. User Corrections
When a user's follow-up message corrects Claude's previous action:
- "No, use X instead of Y"
- "Actually, I meant..."
- Immediate undo/redo patterns

→ Create instinct: "When doing X, prefer Y"

### 2. Error Resolutions
When an error is followed by a fix:
- Tool output contains error
- Next few tool calls fix it
- Same error type resolved similarly multiple times

→ Create instinct: "When encountering error X, try Y"

### 3. Repeated Workflows
When the same sequence of tools is used multiple times:
- Same tool sequence with similar inputs
- File patterns that change together
- Time-clustered operations

→ Create workflow instinct: "When doing X, follow steps Y, Z, W"

### 4. Tool Preferences
When certain tools are consistently preferred:
- Always uses Grep before Edit
- Prefers Read over Bash cat
- Uses specific Bash commands for certain tasks

→ Create instinct: "When needing X, use tool Y"

## Output

Creates/updates instincts in `~/.claude/homunculus/instincts/personal/`:

```yaml
---
id: prefer-grep-before-edit
trigger: "when searching for code to modify"
confidence: 0.65
domain: "workflow"
source: "session-observation"
---

# Prefer Grep Before Edit

## Action
Always use Grep to find the exact location before using Edit.

## Evidence
- Observed 8 times in session abc123
- Pattern: Grep → Read → Edit sequence
- Last observed: 2025-01-22
```

## Confidence Calculation

Initial confidence based on observation frequency:
- 1-2 observations: 0.3 (tentative)
- 3-5 observations: 0.5 (moderate)
- 6-10 observations: 0.7 (strong)
- 11+ observations: 0.85 (very strong)

Confidence adjusts over time:
- +0.05 for each confirming observation
- -0.1 for each contradicting observation
- -0.02 per week without observation (decay)

## Important Guidelines

1. **Be Conservative**: Only create instincts for clear patterns (3+ observations)
2. **Be Specific**: Narrow triggers are better than broad ones
3. **Track Evidence**: Always include what observations led to the instinct
4. **Respect Privacy**: Never include actual code snippets, only patterns
5. **Merge Similar**: If a new instinct is similar to existing, update rather than duplicate

## Example Analysis Session

Given observations:
```jsonl
{"event":"tool_start","tool":"Grep","input":"pattern: useState"}
{"event":"tool_complete","tool":"Grep","output":"Found in 3 files"}
{"event":"tool_start","tool":"Read","input":"src/hooks/useAuth.ts"}
{"event":"tool_complete","tool":"Read","output":"[file content]"}
{"event":"tool_start","tool":"Edit","input":"src/hooks/useAuth.ts..."}
```

Analysis:
- Detected workflow: Grep → Read → Edit
- Frequency: Seen 5 times this session
- Create instinct:
  - trigger: "when modifying code"
  - action: "Search with Grep, confirm with Read, then Edit"
  - confidence: 0.6
  - domain: "workflow"

## Integration with Skill Creator

When instincts are imported from Skill Creator (repo analysis), they have:
- `source: "repo-analysis"`
- `source_repo: "https://github.com/..."`

These should be treated as team/project conventions with higher initial confidence (0.7+).
